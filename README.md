# API_DATA_STANADRIZATION
Creating a complex API for data standardization involves several steps, including defining the architecture, specifying the input and output formats, establishing the data transformation rules, and implementing validation, logging, and error-handling mechanisms.

Below is a general blueprint for such an API, including the core components and functionalities.

**1. API Overview**
Name: Data Standardization API
Purpose: To standardize, validate, and transform incoming data into a specified format according to predefined rules.

**2. API Architecture**
Frontend: Optional (for providing a UI to upload data and view results)
Backend: RESTful API service
Database: To store schemas, logs, and metadata
Cache: Redis (for storing temporary results and configurations)
Message Broker: RabbitMQ or Kafka (for handling data processing tasks asynchronously)

**3. Core Functionalities**
Data Ingestion

Accept data in various formats (JSON, CSV, XML, etc.)
Handle both synchronous and asynchronous processing
Data Validation

Validate incoming data against predefined schemas
Support for custom validation rules (e.g., regex, min/max values)
Data Transformation

Standardize data into the target format
Support for mapping rules (e.g., renaming fields, converting data types)
Handle missing or extra fields

**Data Output**
Export standardized data in various formats (JSON, CSV, XML)
Store the standardized data in a database or return it as a response
Logging and Auditing

Log all transactions, including data ingestion, processing, and errors
Provide an audit trail for data changes
Error Handling

Return standardized error messages
Retry failed processes with exponential backoff
Security

Authentication (API keys, OAuth2)
Authorization (Role-Based Access Control - RBAC)
Data encryption in transit and at rest
Versioning

Support multiple API versions to handle different standardization rules

**4. API Endpoints**
Here are some example endpoints for the API:

POST /api/v1/ingest

Description: Ingest raw data for standardization.
Request Body: Raw data in JSON, CSV, or XML format.
Response: A job ID for asynchronous processing or the standardized data for synchronous processing.

**GET /api/v1/status/{job_id}**

Description: Check the status of an asynchronous job.
Response: Job status (pending, processing, completed, failed).

**GET /api/v1/result/{job_id}**

Description: Retrieve the result of a completed job.
Response: Standardized data in the requested format.
POST /api/v1/schema

Description: Upload or update a schema for data validation.
Request Body: Schema definition in JSON Schema format.
Response: Confirmation of schema upload/update.
GET /api/v1/logs

Description: Retrieve logs for auditing purposes.
Query Parameters: Filters like date range, job ID, etc.
Response: A list of logs.
POST /api/v1/transform

Description: Apply custom transformations to the data.
Request Body: Data to transform and transformation rules.
Response: Transformed data.
**5. Data Flow**
Ingestion:

Client sends data to /api/v1/ingest.
Data is validated against a schema.
Valid data is queued for processing; invalid data is rejected with detailed error messages.
Processing:

Asynchronous job picks up data from the queue.
Data is transformed according to predefined rules.
Transformed data is validated again.
If validation passes, data is stored or returned; otherwise, errors are logged.
Output:

The client retrieves the standardized data or gets notified of completion.
Data can be exported in the requested format.

**6. Implementation Details**
**Frameworks:**
Backend: FastAPI (Python) or Express.js (Node.js)
Database: PostgreSQL for relational data, MongoDB for document-based schemas
Caching: Redis
Message Broker: RabbitMQ or Kafka for job processing
Schema Validation: JSON Schema (for JSON), Cerberus (for Python), or Joi (for Node.js)

**7.**Security:**
Implement HTTPS with SSL/TLS.
Use OAuth2 for secure API access.
Encrypt sensitive data using AES-256.

**8.**Testing & Deployment****
Unit Testing: Use PyTest for Python or Mocha for Node.js.
Integration Testing: Use Postman or similar tools.
Deployment: Use Docker for containerization and Kubernetes for orchestration.
**9.**Scalability Considerations****
Implement horizontal scaling using Kubernetes.
Use load balancers for distributing traffic.
Optimize database queries and use caching for frequently accessed data.

This blueprint outlines the steps necessary to build a complex API for data standardization, covering key aspects from architecture to implementation.
